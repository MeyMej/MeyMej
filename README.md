**👋 Hi, I’m Mejrima**

I’m a Data Scientist with a background in Marketing, and I’m passionate about using data to drive insights and automation. 
After completing a data science training at Le Wagon, I’m excited to build scalable data pipelines, optimize systems, and apply my new skills to solve real-world problems. 
My experience in marketing combined with my recent data science training gives me a unique perspective when tackling challenges.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me exploring new hiking trails 🥾, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen 🍳 or learning new languages 🌍

**My skills**

Python MySQL Git linux Google Analytics
